# FAQ
## Is this based for a specific Linux distro?
No it is not. Icepak should run on any distro. If you experience problems with a certain distro, make a github issue about it, if there isn't one already.

## Is this secure?
I cannot verify either way, in general never run unsafe code, even if it is in a sandbox.
